E-commerce project

I did this project because I had experience with e-commerce websites and applications, and I was eager to create a complete express backend. 


It follows the principle of simple E-commerce websites with secured routes and JWT authorization. 


Since there is a huge sanction against my country(IRAN), I only did the local payment(Zarinpal.ir) and couldn't do the international payment(PayPal)

Including this, I also added a global logger with the Winston package, which logs the whole server to files and MongoDB, and also used custom validation with JOI


I HATE AIs, so I did this README by myself
